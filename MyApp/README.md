# Overview

I specifically chose to focus on java as a language because I noticed a lot of job applications usually prefer an understanding of java. This would also be the first time for me to learn a language completely independent of class. It helped me boost my confidence as a software engineer and gave me another skill to have under my belt.

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Java language.}
The program I wrote is designed to allow a user to enter grocery items they have purchased and their expiration dates. The program would allow users to see an inventory of everything they have, and which items were expired. The user gets an option to remove expired items from the list the moment the program determines it is expired.

One of the reasons I wrote this program is to help me when I want to implement this function into my current group project. We are designing an app that tracks your inventory and gives you recipe ideas based on the food you have. I think it is a good idea for it to show you when your food is expired and remove it from the inventory so the user doesn't have to do that manually.

# Development Environment

I coded this program on Visual Studio Code. I had to go through some extra hoops to get Java working
on Visual Studio. Some of the extensions I put on Visual Studio Code to help me were: Language Support
for Java by Red Hat, Maven for Java, Debugger for Java, Extension Pack for Java, Project Manager for Java, and Test Runner for Java. These all helped me out so much while I was coding this project.

I used Java for this assignment. It was my first time using Java, so I had a lot of figuring out to do. Some of the libraries I imported were:  java.text.ParseException (this helped changing strings into other data types)  java.text.SimpleDateFormat(this helped to convert an input into a date) java.util.Date(I used this library for all things related to date info) java.util.ArrayList (I used this so I could have ArrayLists in my program) java.util.List (this library also helped me with holding my information)

# Future Work

- One thing I would like to improve in the future, is that it uses an actual database to store the food items.
- A second thing I would like to improve in the future is that I would like there to be a better user interface. It's pretty specific and easy to mess up at the moment.
- A third thing I would like to improve in the future is that I would like it to be easier for the user to input the date without fear of being able to mess it up easily.
- A fourth thing I would like to improve in the future in I want it so the user doesn't specifically have to choose to see the expired items.
